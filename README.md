Step 4: Click "Layout Settings" and go to the "Segmented BPT" tab. Click "Add For Current Splits".
Step 5: Select a split that starts a segment in the dropdown, for instance "SSL" starts the "Basement" segment in this run. Click "Add".

Step 6: Configure all the relevant segments, give them aliases if required.

Step 7: Save Layout, you are done, it should now show the BPT to that segment instead of the end of the run. BPT will be displayed after the last segment has been reached.

# Known Issues

- The color pickers do not currently work.
- There is some weird cutoff and scrolling happening in the layout. Sometimes clicking "show/add all" fixes this.
